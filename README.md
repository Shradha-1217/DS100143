# Data Science Internship at DATASOFTISX
# Movie Ratings Analysis, Weather Data Visualization, and Predicting House Prices

# Overview 
This repository contains three data science projects completed during my internship at DATASOFTISX:

1. Movie Ratings Analysis: Exploratory analysis of movie ratings data to uncover trends, patterns, and audience preferences

2. Weather data   Visualization: Visualizationand analysis of weather data to study patterns, trends, and anomalies.

3. Predicting House Prices: A regression-based project to predict house prices based on multiple features.
   
# Datasets

# Dataset Details: 
1. Movie Ratings Dataset: 
 -Contains information on movies, ratings, genres, and user preferences. 
 - Ideal for analyzing audience behavior and movie performance.
2. Weather Dataset:
   - Features daily readings of temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.
   - Suitable for visualizing patterns and detecting anomalies.
3. House Prices Dataset:
   - Contains information like area, location, number of bedrooms, and prices.    - Used for training and testing regression models.

## Project 1: Movie Ratings Analysis 
# Description
This project involves analyzing movie ratings data to identify audience preferences, trends in genres, and the correlation between ratings and other features.
# Key Components- 
- Data Exploration: Understanding the distribution of ratings and genres.
- Visualizations: Bar charts, scatter plots, and trend lines.
- Insights: Popular genres, highest-rated movies, and rating distributions.
# What I Learned
- Techniques for working with movie datasets.
- How to use visualization tools to uncover patterns in audience behavior.
- Correlation analysis to identify factors influencing ratings.

# Project 2: Weather Data Visualization 
# Description
This project visualizes weather data to analyze temperature, precipitation, and humidity trends over time. Patterns and anomalies are explored to provide insights into environmental conditions.

# Key Components-
- Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality by handling missing/invalid values.
- Visualization: Line charts, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.- Anomaly Detection: Highlighting extreme weather events and patterns.
# What I Learned
- Advanced visualization techniques for weather trends.
- Identifying correlations between weather parameters.
- Insights into the impact of anomalies on overall trends.
  
# Project 3: Predicting House Prices 
# Description:
This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset is cleaned, analyzed, and preprocessed to extract meaningful features, followed by training regression models for accurate predictions.
# Key Components
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features.
- Model Training: Using regression techniques to predict prices.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated with RMSE and RÂ² Score.
# What I Learned- How to preprocess data for machine learning models.
- The role of feature selection in improving prediction accuracy.
-  Key factors influencing house prices, such as location and area.

# Tools and Technologies Used
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn- Additional Tools: OpenPyXL (for Excel files)
  
# Outputs
# Movie Ratings Analysis - Bar chart of ratings distribution.
- Pie chart of genre popularity.
- Scatter plot of ratings vs. movie runtime.
# Weather Data Visualization 
- Heatmap of temperature and humidity correlations.
- Time-series graph of daily temperature trends.
- Histogram of temperature distribution with extreme values highlighted.
  
# Predicting House Prices 
- Scatterplot of predicted vs. actual prices.
- Feature importance chart for the regression model.
- Example predictions for sample house data.
